# admin-portal-helm
Holds the required Helm chart packaged artifacts for the admin web portal 

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

```

  helm repo add admin-portal https://szairi2011.github.io/admin-portal-helm/
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo admin-portal` to see the charts having keyword or named admin-portal.

To install the admin-portal chart:

```
    helm install my-admin-portal admin-portal/admin-portal
```

To uninstall the chart:

```
    helm delete my-admin-portal
```
